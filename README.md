# Apple's Swift plugin for Vim

This is a copy of [Apple's Swift tools for Vim](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/master/utils/vim) from their Swift repo. I've put it in a separate repo so that you can easily install it with your prefered plugin installer. (I use [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), so I just add `Plugin 'jph00/swift-apple'` to my `.vimrc` and run `:PluginInstall`.)

It provides syntax highlighting for gyb, SIL, and Swift files, and sets defaults for tab stops etc.
